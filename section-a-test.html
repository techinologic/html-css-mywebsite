                            <p>This page is created from scratch using HTML and CSS. Currently the 3rd version, this time showcasing the CSS Grid Layout with built in responsiveness with the help of CSS flexbox. My editor of choice is Brackets with the extensions Emmet, autosave every edit! and beautify. I use XAMPP in creating a local web server for website testing and deployment purposes, GIMP 2 for image editing, FileZilla to upload files to the server by FTP, Google Docs in embedding documents, twitter for embedded tweets, forecast.io widget for weather, econmic times widget for the tech news, and Google Maps API for my maps. My web references are w3schools, Mozilla Developers, Google Developers, CSS-Tricks, Stackoverflow and materials learned from the class.</p>
